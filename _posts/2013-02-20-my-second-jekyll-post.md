Starting Strength has been very good so far. Reading Andy Bolton's incredibly simple "cycling" methods — basically add small increments until you pull 1000+, ha! — continues to reinforce the fact that simplicity and consistency really are key.

Today I continued with:

## 1. Deadlift ##
* 445 x 5 @ 6.5 (paused below the knee)
* 405 x 5 @ 4.5 (paused below the knee)
* 405 x 1 x 10s static hold (standard, non-hook overhand grip)

Both of these sets were extremely easy. The deadlift bar is easy to double overhand compared to the bars I'm used to.

## 2. Standing Press
* 95 x 8 
* 135 x 3
* 160 x 5 @ 9
* 160 x 5 @ 9
* 160 x 5 @ 9.5

These felt surprsingly solid. Used a good bit of stretch reflex to power out of the bottom.

### 3a. Klokov Press
* 115 x 8 x 4

### 3b. Chins
* BW x 12 x 4

### 4. Various trunk exercises
* Several sets of GHRs, 45 deg. hypers, situps, etc.
