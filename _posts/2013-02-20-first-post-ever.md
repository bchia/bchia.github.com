## Intro

This is my first ever attempt at blogging. I hope to keep this up updated at least somewhat frequently with various tidbits. 

## Tech

I started with an auto-created GitHub page, then dug a litle deeper into Jekyll, and finally found the Jekyll-Bootstrap project. Having some experience with both Bootstrap and Markdown, Jekyll seems like a great way to design, build, and maintain a simple static site with blogging functionality. I love composing in MarkDown and with GitHub hosting I can easily update content from anywhere. As I delve further into Jekyll I'll probably end up re-installing plain Jekyll and create a custom theme built on Bootstrap. For now, I'll just use Jekyll-Bootstrap and rip off Twitter and Google for the look and feel. 

**UPDATE**: After some finangling with Jekyll some of the limitations of the framework start to appear rather quickly. For example, there is no straightforward way to do something as simple as [ordering posts or pages](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/issues/42). Now this probably wouldn't be an issue for simple landing pages or blogs, but it does seem like a pretty big crutch. The [creator](https://github.com/plusjade) of Jekyll-Bootstrap has since moved on to another language agnostic static website/blogging framework, [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com), in order to address these limitations. I may look into this, but for now, I'm still loving the simplicity of Jekyll and GitHub pages.
