## Intro

This is my first ever attempt at blogging. I hope to keep this up updated at least somewhat frequently with various tidbits of my life â€” work (pause|break and EventBooking.com), training (strength, conditioning, and powerlifting), arts (photography, design, music, etc), travel, and other various ramblings. 

## Technicals

I started with an auto-created GitHub page, then dug a litle bit into Jekyll, and finally found the Jekyll-Bootstrap project. Having some experience with both Bootstrap and Markdown, Jekyll seems like THE way to design, build, and maintain a simple static site with blogging functionality. I am eager to learn more and will probably end up re-installing a plain Jekyll instance with my own custom theme built on Bootstrap. For now, I'll rip off Twitter and Google for the look and feel.
