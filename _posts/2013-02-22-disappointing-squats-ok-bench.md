### 1. Squat

Worked up to 315x3 and 350x2. Although the weight felt light, my left hip feels like it's going to explode. The only things I have done differently this week is foam rolling and hip mobility stretching. Perhaps this "prehab" shit fucked me up going too aggresive on the hip mobility. Going to rest it up a little before I resume squatting but I may take it easier on the modalities.

### 2. Bench press

* 135 x 8
* 185 x 5
* 225 x 3
* 255 x 3 @ 8.5 (paused each rep)
* 255 x 3 @ 8.5 (paused each rep)
* 255 x 3 @ 8 (paused each rep)
* 290 x 2 (touch and go)
* 240 x 5 (close grip, t&g)
* 275 x 3 (t&g)

Bench felt pretty good today. Was only supposed to do 250 x 5 x 3 but everything felt awesome.

### 3. Close-grip floor press

* 225 x many sets of doubles and triples
* 225 x 5 for a top set

### 4. Dips
* BW x 20 x 2 sets
